# Gomoku Learning Project

This project is designed as a tool to learn some new languages / technologies /
protocols and may well expand as it goes along. It will be based around the game
gomoku as this was a really fun and simple game we had to code in first year
computer science. So the ideas I would like to explore are:

## Test Driven Design

I have been poor in implementing testing for my code, and I would like to
include this at every step of this project.

## Go

I will be learning go and creating a little game server that will manage games
and users. The server will be responsible for:
* Authenticating users -- and creating users.
* Creating Gomoku games
* Verifying moves and checking game state

I will also build a text-based client so that games can be played with CLI.

What I would like to learn from this:
* The Go language itself
* Go ORM
* Go HTTP stuff -- mainly for authentication
* Go WebSocket stuff -- mainly for communicating to/from server for games as
  well as maybe a simple chat server
  
## Django + socket.io ##

This I will use to create a simple web interface to the GoMoku server. I am very
familiar with django already, so this will largely be about the browser/client
side of things.

## C++

I would like to implement a bot that plays Gomoku -- this will just be getting
myself up-to-speed with some of the newer features available in C++11/14.

## Tensorflow

Another bot -- here I would like to implement some machine-learning algorithms
to make a competitive player.

## Clojure

Another bot -- I've not done any functional programming in ages and would like
to give this a go -- maybe give some genetic algorithms a go?

## Kotlin and/or C#+Unity

For making a phone interface...
